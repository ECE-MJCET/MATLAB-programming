**Title: MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox and DSP System Toolbox: Filter Analysis and Design**

 Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox and DSP System Toolbox! This repository provides comprehensive tools and resources for filter analysis and design, empowering users to effectively analyze signals and design filters tailored to their specific requirements.

 Features

 Signal Processing Toolbox

- **Filter Analysis**: Explore the characteristics and behavior of filters in the time and frequency domains.
- **Frequency Response Analysis**: Analyze the magnitude and phase response of filters using functions like `freqz` and `fvtool`.
- **Pole-Zero Analysis**: Understand filter stability and behavior through pole-zero analysis using functions like `zp2tf` and `zplane`.
- **Impulse and Step Response Analysis**: Analyze the impulse and step responses of filters to understand their transient behavior.

 DSP System Toolbox

- **Filter Design**: Design filters with specific frequency response characteristics to meet application requirements.
- **FIR Filter Design**: Utilize functions like `fir1`, `fir2`, and `firpm` for designing Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters.
- **IIR Filter Design**: Design Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters using functions like `butter`, `cheby1`, `cheby2`, and `ellip`.
- **Multirate Filter Design**: Design filters for resampling and rate conversion using functions like `firdecim` and `firinterp`.
